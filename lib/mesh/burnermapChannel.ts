// the citywide BurnerMap mesh. (Tight groups can instead generate a private crew
// channel — see randomPsk() in channelSet.ts.)

// The PSK is PUBLIC on purpose (a community channel, like Burntastic's shared key).
// Playa-tuned LoRa defaults: region US, LONG_FAST (range across the 7-mile city),
// MQTT off (no internet on the playa), hop limit 3. channelNum 0 = the frequency
// slot is derived from the channel name+PSK, which puts BurnerMap on its own slot,
// off the congested public default.

// Fixed 32-byte AES256 key for the public channel (published intentionally).
